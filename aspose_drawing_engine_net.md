# System.Drawing replacement with Aspose.Drawing

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Aspose.Drawing for .NET is a powerful cross-platform program library for 2D graphics drawing. The Aspose library can be used as an alternative to System.Drawing package.
On May 22, 2023, on Microsoft Learn portal was published an article about a breaking change: 
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only">System.Drawing.Common only supported on Windows</a>. Now, if you try to compile a program with the System.Drawing.Common package on non-Windows environments, the exception will be thrown that your platform is not supported.

# Aspose.Drawing alternative to System.Drawing

Aspose.Drawing package is available for download from the  <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Drawing">NuGet package manager repository</a>.
