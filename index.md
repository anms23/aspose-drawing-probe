</p>


## System.Drawing.Common limitations

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On May 22, 2023, the Microsoft Learn portal published an article detailing a significant change: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only">System.Drawing.Common only supported on Windows</a>. If you attempt to compile a .NET6 program using the System.Drawing.Common package on non-Windows environments, you will encounter an exception indicating that your platform is not supported. Although it is possible to disable this warning on .NET6, it is strongly recommended to migrate to alternative libraries.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This issue arises from the fact that System.Drawing.Common relies on a 3rd party graphic library called `GDP+`, which includes native code and lacks necessary functionality. Additionally, `GDP+` has external dependencies on other native libraries like `cairo` and `pango`. When using System.Drawing.Common on platforms different from Windows, you may encounter unpredictable behavior and platform errors within your drawing application. As a consequence, your rendered images may appear different on other platforms, leading to unexpected results.
</p>


## Why choose Aspose.Drawing.Common for System.Drawing.Common replacement

# Cross-platform drawing API for C# (.NET)

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Asp.Drawing library provides a cross-platform C# API for creating geometric drawings. With Asp.Drawing, you can effortlessly draw vector images such as lines, shapes, rectangles, polygons, arcs, Bezier curves, and text with various fonts and styles. Additionally, you can apply different transformations to 2D objects and save the results as raster or vector files. You can utilize the same Aspose library as a drawing API for Windows, Linux, Azure, or as a graphic API for ASP sites, ensuring consistent quality and performance across all target platforms.
</p>

## How drawing lines and shapes

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this example, we demonstrate how to create a series of graphic primitives, including lines, rectangles, and ellipses, using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/drawpath/">DrawPath method</a>. To start, we create a bitmap with a size of `1000x800` pixels and a color depth of 32 bits per pixel. Next, we define a Pen object with two properties: the color set to `Blue` and a width of 2
pixels, which will be used for drawing the images, along with a <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphicspath/">Path object</a>. Following that, we sequentially add two lines to the Path, each defined by its starting and ending X, Y coordinates: one from (100, 100) to (1000, 400), and another line from (1000, 600) to (300, 600); a Rectangle with the following specifications: left upper corner at (0, 0), width of 200, and height of 400 pixels; and an Ellipse object fitted within a rectangle, positioned at the left upper corner (10, 200), with a width of 450 and a height of 300 pixels. Using the DrawPath method and the previously described Pen object, we draw the Path onto the created bitmap. Finally, we rasterize the image and save it as a PNG file.
</p>

C# code example:
```cs
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;

namespace Aspose.Drawing.Examples.CSharp.LinesCurvesShapes
{
    class DrawPath
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            //ExStart: DrawPath
            Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 800, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);
            Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);

            Pen pen = new Pen(Color.FromKnownColor(KnownColor.Blue), 2);
            GraphicsPath path = new GraphicsPath();
            path.AddLine(100, 100, 1000, 400);
            path.AddLine(1000, 600, 300, 600);
            path.AddRectangle(new Rectangle(500, 350, 200, 400));
            path.AddEllipse(10, 250, 450, 300);
            graphics.DrawPath(pen, path);

            bitmap.Save(RunExamples.GetDataDir() + @"LinesCurvesShapes\DrawPath_out.png");
            //ExEnd: DrawPath
        }
    }
}
```

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The C# code above will draw the following image with Lines, Rectangles and Ellipses:

</p>
</figure>

You can find more examples in <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/drawpath/">Aspose documentation</a>.


## How to make geometric drawings with arcs and Bezier curves

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Similar to the previous example of 2D geometrics drawings, to draw an arc, we begin by creating a 1000x800 bitmap and then proceed to create a Pen object with the color `Blue`` and a width of `2` px. Next, we create an arc object with <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/drawarc/">method `DrawArc`</a>. As method parameters, we pass the object `Pen`` followed by rectangle coordinates where our arc will be fitted: upper left point (0, 0) and bottom right point (700, 700). And the last two parameters are begin and end angles to draw the arc: from 0 degrees to 180 degrees. Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the x-axis to the starting point of the arc.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
</figure>

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The C# code example to draw an Bezier curve:
</p>

```cs
Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 800, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);
Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);

Pen pen = new Pen(Color.FromKnownColor(KnownColor.Blue), 2);
PointF p1 = new PointF(0, 0);   // start point
PointF c1 = new PointF(0, 800);   // first control point
PointF c2 = new PointF(1000, 0);  // second control point
PointF p2 = new PointF(1000, 800);  // end point
graphics.DrawBezier(pen, p1, c1, c2, p2);

bitmap.Save(RunExamples.GetDataDir() + @"LinesCurvesShapes\DrawBezierSpline_out.png");
```
