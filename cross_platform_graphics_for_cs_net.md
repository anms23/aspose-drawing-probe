Graphic libraries for .NET are used not only on the Windows platform but also very popular for other systems like Linux, Android or WebAssembly. The big advantage of Aspose.Drawing - is a cross-platform solution, you can use it at the same time on different platforms. Development with the same library streamlines the application creation process. You can reuse once-developed code on multiple platforms. Aspose.Drawing library capabilities provides you with a whole range of 2D drawing features as:
</p>

- Creating bitmaps from scratch or loading from files.
- Drawing lines, Bezier curves, splines, and arcs.
- Drawing shapes such as rectangles, polygons, eclipses, etc.
- Processing and drawing graphics paths.
- Rendering text with different fonts and styles.
- Using different pen widths and styles.
- Using solid and texture brushes.
- Alpha blending and anti-aliasing lines and shapes.
- Working with clip regions.
- Using affine transformations.
