&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Drawing images with graphic libraries is a very demanding operation for developers, researchers, students and managers who create graphic applications and services on .NET platform. Aspose.Drawing is a modern cross-platform image library with enhanced capabilities. With the Aspose library for .NET it is possible effectively draw lines and shapes using different Pen and Brush objects, create texts with different fonts and styles, make various transformations and raster images in all commonly used graphics file formats. The ready-to-use graphic library helps to increase productivity, dramatically reduce development and time-to-market period. The Microsoft System.Drawing.Common library recently changed its support for non-Windows platforms and Aspose.Drawing will be a proper replacement for drawing images.

On May 22, 2023, the Microsoft Learn portal published an article about a breaking change: 
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only">System.Drawing.Common only supported on Windows</a>. Now, if you try to compile a program with the System.Drawing.Common package on non-Windows environments, the exception will be thrown that your platform is not supported. Despite of you can still switch off this warning, it is recommended to migrate to other libraries. Aspose.Drawing is a good choice for drawing application development for .NET Framework, .NET Core and for Xamarin applications for Windows, Linux, Android, Azure Functions or Blazor WebAssembly.
