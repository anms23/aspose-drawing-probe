<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Creating images using graphic libraries can be a challenging task for developers, researchers, students, and managers involved in building graphic applications and services on the .NET platform. Aspose.Drawing is a contemporary cross-platform image library that offers advanced features and functionality. By utilizing the Aspose library for .NET, developers can efficiently draw lines and shapes using diverse Pen and Brush objects, generate texts with varying fonts and styles, perform different transformations, and raster drawings into popular graphics file formats. This readily-available graphic library significantly boosts productivity, drastically reduces development time, and accelerates time-to-market. Microsoft's System.Drawing.Common library has recently altered its support for non-Windows platforms, making Aspose.Drawing a suitable alternative for image drawings.

On May 22, 2023, the Microsoft Learn portal published an article detailing a significant change: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only">System.Drawing.Common only supported on Windows</a>. If you attempt to compile a .NET6 program using the System.Drawing.Common package on non-Windows environments, you will encounter an exception indicating that your platform is not supported. Although it is possible to disable this warning on .NET6, it is strongly recommended to migrate to alternative libraries.
